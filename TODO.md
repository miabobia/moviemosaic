# LETTERBOXD-GRID

Generates grid of movies recently watched by a letterboxd user and their ratings

## TODO

## IMPORTANT
- add homebutton
- add socials
- add instructions page
- make stars bigger
- fix username_info_text
- add button for last month

## EXTRA
- add column to RESULTS table that stores file_paths. I want file_paths to images served up in dynamic page instead of inserting blobs straight into HTML so browser can cache
- change font
- add user's full name instead of username on generated image option (checkbox)

### EXTRA EXTRA (probly never happening)
- css styling
